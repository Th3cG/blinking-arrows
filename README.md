This sketch is intended to simulate the rear lights behavior in a car:

-pressing left arrow switches on a progressive left arrow;
-pressing right arrow switches on a progressive right arrow;
-pressing up arrow switches on emergency arrows;

The arrows can be switched on and off pressing again the same keys, 
while to show the brake lights the user has to keep down arrow pressed.
